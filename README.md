- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designed for a small driving school business run by the owner Liam and supporting staff. Client wants an online platform that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, take practice test, and track progress. All while being secure and allowing management of these requirements by IT staff.

- What did you do particularly well?
Requirements were very clear which helped map out how the system should work via diagrams.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The diagrams could be more specific and some lacked clarity due to oversight on the designers end. Ensuring the     diagrams are logical and that all outcomes are covered. As well as fully matching the use cases to the diagrams.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider    the user’s needs when designing?
I used the clients goals to shape every feature. Considering the users need is required to make the system useful and easy to adopt.

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and         design a system?
I gather requirements, break them into parts, and use diagrams. In the future, I’d do more prototypes and get user feedback earlier.
